Growing up till the age of 28 which is shocking for the amount of years a horse can actually live and also remarkable as well. He has grown older than some humans have had the chance to, sadly passing away yet still his name remains as a legend in the horse racing business and is recognized globally. He has influenced the training and breeding of other horses and has served a great inspiration to horse trainers also by the legacy of his greatness left behind. Seattle Slew can definitely be considered as one of the best race horses to have ever kicked the grounds of the race tracks.\n")

This automatically speaks enough about her reputation thus far and as far as ranked best race horses are concerned, she most certainly has the spirit of some famous human “godmother” we know, who do you picture that comes to mind? Zenyatta has also been the 2010 Race horse of the year due to carrying most of the weight during any other male or female horse of that year’s major races.

Which all in all generated a winning total of $1,316,808 to be an exact figure.
